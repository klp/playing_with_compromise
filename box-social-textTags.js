She was a bit pale and looked much thinner, but she simply had to go. All that evening she sat in the kitchen cutting up old scraps of wallpaper and pasting them on the shoe-box, in various patterns with flour paste. Her box of lunch would be the prettiest there and the men would bid so high for it.",

Little useless things, for her real vocation had apparently been to stay home and help her aunt with the housework. What she needed now was something to line the box with. It would look so much more beautiful with the sandwiches and the little bottle of olives set against some deep rich colour. Shoe-boxes were so wonderfully white.",

She was in the outhouse searching in the tiny attic for a roll of gorgeous parlour wallpaper she remembered her aunt having left there. Her father always forgot to put down the lids; the two holes stared at her like a man with a large eye and a small one. Finding what she wanted, she stepped out and stood still for a moment.

The very next field was lined with furrows as if it had been a large frown or a copy-book. It was not her father's field. Someone else had plowed it. Furrow after furrow after furrow his house lay away where he now lay sleeping and she hated him. Then, her own house—a faint pale light from the two kitchen windows. There the decorated shoe-box lay almost ready for the box-social. Every room of the house, both in their ancient, and modern styles met in parliament on its flat thin sides.",

Mrs. Twite wasn't dancing at all, not even with her husband, because they used the school as a Sunday school on Sundays and it would be like dancing in a church.

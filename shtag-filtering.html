      <h1>Filtering The Story of an Hour by Tag</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        <p>Each paragraph of "The Story of an Hour" has been assigned tags pertaining to its content. Here, we've filtered the story on the tags defined below. The tags are the same across all three stories, but not all stories use all of the tags; unused tags have not been included. This story does not use the "labor," "night," "light," or "baby" tags. </p>

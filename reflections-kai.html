    <h1>Kai's Reflections</h1>
    <h6>Inception</h6>
      <p>
        The origins of this project for me started at the beginning of the 
        semester. I had a brainworm nagging at me: What would a clearer, more 
        expository and exploratory alternative to <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a> look like? The 
        ridiculous follow-up would be: Could I build a reasonable facsimile of 
        this alternative in a semester? The answer to the second question given 
        my employment situation, class schedule, and personal life is a firm no, 
        but my original brainworm will inform some of my reflections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Independent of my original vision, a joint project for Digital 
        Humanities tends to butter my toast; adding a pair of eyes and a 
        different brain to an academic project helps uncover blindspots under 
        tight deadlines. I'm also a proponent of complementary skill sets in 
        teams. When Bri proposed working together on a text-based deformance project,
         I jumped at the chance.  
      </p>
    <h6>Theory and Practice </h6>
      <p>
        As mentioned in our 
        <a href="https://klp.github.io/playing_with_compromise/">
        project introduction</a>, the practice of deformance provides our 
        theoretical bulwark against trivializing our approach. My 
        introduction to these types of practices came from a class taught two 
        years by <a href="https://qcenglish.commons.gc.cuny.edu/people/kevin-l-ferguson/">
        Kevin L. Ferguson</a> called Alternative Digital Cultures. 
        Using Samuels and McGann's seminal work on deformance and Stephen 
        Ramsey's <em>The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around; or What You Do with a 
        Million Books</em> as a launchpad, the class focused on small project 
        work, often deforming and experimenting with ways to defamilize 
        digital media. Examples of my own work from that class include a 
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/532668376">video PechaKucha</a> and a series 
        of movie screenshots animated by the astrology software 
        <a href="https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/">StarStax</a>. 
        Other, more professional efforts from Ferguson are 
        <a href="https://filmvis.tumblr.com/">here</a>, and from one of his fellow 
        travelers <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/6603776">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer the background above for useful contrast to our project output.
        On the one hand, our transformations of the targeted texts falls 
        squarely within the types of deformance examined in Samuels and McGann,
        with an emphasis on methods one can use without computer/digital 
        assistance: reading backwards (our paragraph reversals), focusing on 
        parts of speech, etc. However, when comparing these manipulations with
        the examples from Alternative Digital Cultures, I'm struck by
        methods that use the medium qua material, deforming in ways 
        only made accessible with digital technologies and tools.
      </p>
    <h6>Contributions</h6>
      <p>
        Contributions can be gleaned from the 
        <a href="https://github.com/klp/playing_with_compromise/commits/main">
        commit history</a> of our repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my code contribution was built with Compromise. For this project 
        I also managed some merge complications in  our Git repo,  tried to pull
        the site together into a cohesive whole with a navigation, paratext, 
        style, and so on. I am paricularly proud of the <a href="adjective-noun.html">Adjective&#8211;Noun Pairs</a>,
        which could provide a nice band/project name generation machine. In fact
        the project name was created from three adjective&#8211;noun pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        One covert goal of how I wanted to contribute to this project was to 
        create scaffolding for Bri to focus on learning the technical skills 
        she was interested in. Outside of one hiccup related to learning how 
        Git works, I think this goal was met.
      </p>
    <h6>Challenges</h6>
      <p>
        I am always cutting scope for these class projects. Estimating effort 
        for this type of techincal work is notoriously difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        One challenge I faced was the relative maturity of the Compromise 
        library. The development effort is lead by one contributor, and while 
        updates are made regularly at present, the creator himself admits to 
        shortcomings:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        compromise tries its best to turn text into data.
          it makes limited and sensible decisions.
                  it's not as smart as you'd think. 
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This limited nature resulted in a fair amount of corrections and refinement
        on my end to make some of the parts of speech parsing and tokenization
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        One aspect of collaboration in Digital Humanities projects that I don't 
        always account for is training about code version control systems, in 
        our case, Git and GitHub. The CUNY Graduate Center and the 
        <a href="https://gcdri.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">GC Digital Research Institute (GCDRI)</a> do provide 
        adequate training for use of these versioning tools in a single 
        contributor scenario. The second collaboration is necessary, the value 
        and complication of Git workflows becomes apparent. It's not intuitive
        or straightforward to learn how to branch, resolve merge conflicts, or
        keep a feature branch up to date with production. I commend Bri for 
        sticking with it, and I was happy to provide assistance shuffling code 
        between repositories and solving merge conflicts while she came up to 
        speed on how to work collaboratively in a GitHub repository. Again, 
        these tools are not always intuitive until you've worked with them for
        a while.
      </p>
    <h6>Potential Evolutions </h6>
      <p>
        What would a clearer, more expository and exploratory alternative to 
        Voyant Tools look like?
      </p>
      <p>Using this project as a basis to understand that question, I will point
        out three factors that would be critical for future evolutions:
        <ul>
          <li>Provide tools for site visitors to create their own deformances
            <ul>
              <li>
                Move natural language processing (NLP) to a server-side application to allow 
                visitors to upload their own texts, and provide better 
                tokenization, parsing, and calculation performance
              </li>
              <li>
                Create an interface for visitors to initiate one or a 
                combination of deformative techiques and filtering
              </li>
              <li>
                Add more whismy into the deformance types&#8212;for another 
                class this semester, I created a 
                <a href="https://klp.github.io/our-mutual-language-processor/select-random-sentence.html">
                  random phrase selector</a> from Charles Dickens' <em>Our 
                  Mutual Friend</em> that stands as a pale version of the types 
                  of whimsy I'd like to include in the deformances available in 
                  a future tool
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Related to my own Digital Humanities journey, this project puts me at a 
        fork in the path. Before this semester, I was convinced that I would 
        pursue a traditional thesis about the cultural poetics and history of 
        pre-personal computers. After starting this project, I wonder if an 
        equally interesting option would be a capstone attempting to build 
        a genuine alternative to Voyant Tools. The major tradeoff in building a 
        capstone would be abandoning what brought me back to graduate school in 
        the first place: a chance to research, process information, and practice
        articulating it clearly and effectively to an audience. The downside of 
        pursuing a written thesis would be opting out of a chance to focus on 
        delivering a comprehensive product in a structured environment using 
        web technologies I've been tickled to learn this semester.
